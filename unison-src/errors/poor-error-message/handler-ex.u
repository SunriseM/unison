--Line 13, columns 44-46 has a type mismatch (in red below):

--   13 |   {Ask.ask _ -> k} -> handle supply t in k ()

--The two types involved are:
--
--  () (an intrinsic, in blue)
--  Text (line 8, columns 30-34, in green)
--
--    8 | supply : Text -> Request (Ask Text) a -> a

-- Verbiage could be improved, but also the `()` location should
-- point to line 22, the `k ()` call.
ability Ask foo where
  ask : () -> {Ask a} a

supply : Text -> Request (Ask Text) a -> a
supply t e = case e of
  {a} -> a
  -- `k` should be of type `Text -> Request Ask a`,
  -- so calling it with `()` here should be a type error
